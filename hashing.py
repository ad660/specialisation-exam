Design of Hash Function:

An example of a hashing function is a library where books are arranged according to a special code that is taken from
the title.

To obtain this code, the librarian uses a method that qualifies each both using a method that labels them as though they
are ASCII values and add up the values of the letters in the title.
If there's no collision then the book will be placed on an empty shelf if its title code points to it and of
the title code points ot an occupied shelf the librarian will have to recalculate where to shelve it.
